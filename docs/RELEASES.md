# Releases

## Overview

Releases are generated by GitHub Actions + GoReleaser.

Trigger:

- Push a tag matching `v*` (example: `v1.0.0`)

Artifacts:

- `darwin/amd64` (macOS Intel)
- `darwin/arm64` (macOS Apple Silicon)
- `linux/amd64` (Ubuntu-compatible binary)
- `linux/arm64`
- `windows/amd64`
- `windows/arm64`

Archives are uploaded to GitHub Releases with checksums.

## Homebrew

The release workflow publishes/updates a Homebrew formula through GoReleaser.

By default, tap target values are read from workflow environment:

- `HOMEBREW_TAP_OWNER`
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_NAME`
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_BRANCH`

The workflow sets these to the current GitHub repository owner/name/branch,
so the same repository can act as a tap.

## Local Snapshot Release

```sh
make release-snapshot
```

This builds release artifacts locally without publishing.
